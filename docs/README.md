## üö¶ Getting Started

### 1. Local Development (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LamNgo1911/mealsync.git
cd mealsync

# Start development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Access the application
# API: http://localhost:8081
# Health: http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging (10 minutes)

```bash
# Build and push Docker image
docker build -t username/mealsync-app:latest .
docker push username/mealsync-app:latest

# Deploy to staging server
ssh user@staging-server
cd ~/mealsync
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
```

### 3. Deploy to Production (Automated)

```bash
# Push to main branch - CI/CD handles the rest
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Build Docker image
# 3. Deploy with zero downtime
# 4. Verify health checks
# 5. Rollback if failed
```

---

## üîë Key Concepts

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

**Problem**: Traditional deployments cause 30-60 seconds of downtime, losing active user sessions.

**Solution**: Rolling updates with health checks
1. Start new container alongside old one
2. Wait for new container to be healthy
3. Route traffic to new container
4. Gracefully shutdown old container

**Result**: No downtime, no lost requests

---

### Health Checks

**Why**: Ensure containers are ready before receiving traffic

**Endpoints**:
- `/actuator/health` - Overall health
- `/actuator/health/liveness` - Is app alive?
- `/actuator/health/readiness` - Is app ready?

**Usage**: Load balancers use these to route traffic only to healthy instances

---

### Graceful Shutdown

**Why**: Prevent request loss during shutdown

**How**: 
1. Stop accepting new requests
2. Complete existing requests (up to 30s)
3. Close database connections
4. Exit

**Configuration**:
```properties
server.shutdown=graceful
spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase=30s
```

## üÜò Common Questions

### Q: How do I deploy without downtime?

**A**: Use the zero-downtime deployment workflow:
```bash
# Automated (recommended)
git push origin main

# Manual
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps mealsync-app
```

See: [Infrastructure Guide - Zero-Downtime Deployment](./INFRASTRUCTURE.md#zero-downtime-deployment)

---

### Q: How do I scale to handle more users?

**A**: Follow the scaling guide phases:
1. Enable horizontal scaling (multiple instances)
2. Add database read replicas
3. Implement Redis caching
4. Set up CDN for images

See: [Scaling Guide](./SCALING_GUIDE.md)

---

### Q: How do I monitor the application?

**A**: Use Spring Boot Actuator endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health

# Metrics
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics

# Prometheus format
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/prometheus
```

See: [Infrastructure Guide - Monitoring](./INFRASTRUCTURE.md#monitoring--health-checks)

---

### Q: What if deployment fails?

**A**: The CI/CD pipeline automatically rolls back:
1. Health checks fail on new container
2. Old container continues serving traffic
3. New container is removed
4. Logs are captured for debugging

Manual rollback:
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

See: [Deployment Cheat Sheet - Emergency Procedures](./DEPLOYMENT_CHEATSHEET.md#-emergency-procedures)

---

### Q: How much does it cost to run at scale?

**A**: Cost estimates by user count:

| Users | Monthly Cost |
|-------|--------------|
| 500 | $50 |
| 2,000 | $150 |
| 5,000 | $300 |
| 10,000 | $600 |
